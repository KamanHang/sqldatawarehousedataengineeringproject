# Handling Duplicate Data by Primary Values
- Using Row_Number()
- I calculated the row_number of those records which are duplicate based upon their creation date and chose only the recent record.

# Handling Spaces in String Data
- Using TRIM() for removing leading and trailing spaced

# Data Standardization and Consistency
- Using CASE WHEN statement for data standardization like for M for Male and F for Female in cst_gndr column
- Similarly using CASE WHEN statement for data standardization like M for Married and S for Single in cst_marital_status column.
