#  SQL Data Warehouse and Data Analytics Project
This Project focuses into two different sections:
- Data Engineering
- Data Analytics and Reporting

## Data Engineering
In this section of the project I have performed following tasks:
- Implemented Medallion Architecture to develop data pipeline for more high quality data.
- Developed ETL Pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Extracted raw data from CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) data sources to BRONZE Layer of the Data Warehouse.
- Performed Data Cleansing tasks for Qualitative Data (Used PL/pgSQL): Removing Duplicates, Handling Unwanted Spaces, missing and invalid data, Data Type Casting and Filtering in SILVER Layer.
- Performed Data Modeling by creating FACTS & DIMENSIONS Table for high quality data analysis in GOLD Layer.

## Data Analytics and Reporting

# ⛩️ Data Architecture

One of the important thing I learned during this project is the Medallion Data Architecture.<br>
ETL (Extract, Transfer and Load) are the fundamentals of Data Engineering. <br> 
However, "Medallion Data Architecture" helped me to design and build robust, scaleable data warehouse.

# Data LINEAGE
Data Lineage is new thing I learned during this project development which helped me to track and map the flow of data into the data warehouse. <br><br>
<i>*Note: Data Lineage will be updated as we go further into the project*</i>

# Data Integration
From the Below diagram we get an idea about the connections between different CRM and ERP tables available in database. <br><br>
